This directory is intentionally empty. We use this to cache data we download from the web so that we don't have to access the same data from the web several times in a short period. We don't want to check them in. Explanation: Sometimes websites like EDGAR, Alpha Vantage etc. are slow. And many have limits on how many API calls/day are allowed for free accounts. But while developing the code, we tend to often run the code several times on the same day or a short period of time when we don't expect to see changes in the data in the database in question. For example, we don't expect the financial data of companies on EDGAR to change every day. We use our discretion while building APIs as to what is the reasonable time after which we should download fresh data.  

Note: The gitignore contains some fileformats in which we usually store data such as csv, xls, xlsx. So the cache files, if present in this format, will not show up when you do *git status* or added when you do *git add*. But if you happen to use a different method to store data in this directory, please make sure the corresponding file extension is added to gitignore.
